# Word-Guess-Game (HangMan)
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

On Wins: it is showing numbers of times the user has guessed the letter correctly

On Losses: it is showing numbers of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses

Number of Guesses Remaining show the numbers of guesses left. This will update

Letters Already Guessed: Show your Guesses, the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
